## Introduction

Humanoid robots are remarkable creations that **closely resemble the human form**, featuring an array of advanced technologies and capabilities. With their human-like appearance and ability to perform intricate tasks, humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and entertainment to manufacturing and personal assistance. These robots possess articulated limbs, sophisticated sensors, and artificial intelligence algorithms, enabling them to navigate complex environments, interact with humans, and mimic human gestures and expressions.

| **1495 - Leonardo’s Robot**          | An inventor Leonardo da Vinci designed a suit of armour that moved as if there was a real person inside. It was operated by a series of pulleys and cables, it could do various human-like movements. The goal was merely to amuse Milanese royalty, but modern recreations of the device have shown that it was fully functional.                                |                                       ![leonardo image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Leonardo-Robot3.jpg/440px-Leonardo-Robot3.jpg)                                       |
| **1774 - The Jacquet-Droz Automata** | Pierre Jacquet-Droz, his son Henri-Louis, and Jean-Frédéric Leschot created three automata that are still operational today. One is a female robot musician who plays an organ with her fingers, another is a child robot artist capable of drawing four different images, and the third is a child robot writer who can write up to 40 characters using a quill. |                          ![robot image](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bb0536893fc04255997b40/1534602058526-D1HXFNZSNJGU0IVWX0G5/Jaquet+Droz+History+4.jpg)                           |
| **1970 - WABOT-1**                   | The first digitally controlled anthropomorphic robot was built at Waseda University in Tokyo. It had a limb-control system with tactile sensors for walking and gripping, a vision system that could measure distances, and a conversation system that could communicate in Japanese.                                                                             |                                                ![image](https://bostonglobalforum.org/aiwsin/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2021/01/c7d5b.179.large_.jpg)                                                 |
