## Introduction

Humanoid robots are remarkable creations that **closely resemble the human form**, featuring an array of advanced technologies and capabilities. With their human-like appearance and ability to perform intricate tasks, humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and entertainment to manufacturing and personal assistance. These robots possess articulated limbs, sophisticated sensors, and artificial intelligence algorithms, enabling them to navigate complex environments, interact with humans, and mimic human gestures and expressions.

## History [^1]

**1495 - Leonardo’s Robot** - famed inventor Leonardo da Vinci designed a suit of armour that moved as if there was a real person inside. It was operated by a series of pulleys and cables, and could stand, sit, move its arms, and even raise its visor to reveal nothing inside. The goal was merely to amuse Milanese royalty, but modern recreations of the device have shown that it was fully functional.

**1774 - The Jacquet-Droz Automata** - Pierre Jacquet-Droz, his son Henri-Louis, and Jean-Frédéric Leschot created three automata that are still operational today. One is a female robot musician who plays an organ with her fingers, another is a child robot artist capable of drawing four different images, and the third is a child robot writer who can write up to 40 characters using a quill. These lifelike robots can be observed at the Museum of Art History in Neuchâtel.

**1970 - WABOT-1** - The first digitally controlled anthropomorphic robot was built at Waseda University in Tokyo. It had a limb-control system with tactile sensors for walking and gripping, a vision system that could measure distances, and a conversation system that could communicate in Japanese. The researchers estimated that it had the mental faculties of a child aged about one and a half.

**2000 - Asimo** - One of the world’s most famous robots was first assembled. Honda designed and developed Asimo as a multi-functional mobile assistant that could help people with poor mobility. It could recognize objects, gestures, sounds, and faces, allowing it to interact with humans, and was capable of fully autonomous navigation with a top speed of 1.8 m.p.h. Later upgrades bumped that to 3.7 m.p.h. and added the ability to climb stairs–something it spectactularly failed to do in its first demonstration in December 2006 but successfully completed a month later.

**2016 - Sophia** - Hanson Robotics unveiled Sophia, a humanoid robot capable of expressing emotions and holding conversations. It was designed to look like Audrey Hepburn, and has been granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Sophia has appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and has been interviewed by the likes of CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times.
