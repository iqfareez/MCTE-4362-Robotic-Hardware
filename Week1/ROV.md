## History of ROV

In **1953**, ROV were first build by Dimitri Rebikoff. The name is the Poodle.

In **1960**, navy has deployed ROVs to recover torpedos, bombs, mines etc. The vehicle is used in dangerous places for sailors such as mine area.

The initial commercial vehicle for the offshore oil industry was introduced in **1975**.

Later, in **1980s**, ROVs are used by the offshore oil industry to asssist development.

Today, more than 90% of the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) created have been designed for commercial offshore activities such as supporting oil and gas drilling, inspecting, burying, and repairing pipelines and telecommunications cables.

## Applications of ROV

ROV are used in several missions:

- Pipeline inspection in **O&G industry**

- **Science:** To study deep-sea flora and fauna, sample water, and recover shipwrecks for underwater archaeology projects.

  [NOAA](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/rov.html) said:

  > ROVs, allow us to explore the ocean without actually being in the ocean.

- **Military and law enforcement** (search and rescue): For surveillance, search and recovery missions, disposing of explosives, and detecting environmental hazards.
- **Film** and documentary

- **Maritime**: Allow vessel owners to detect and quickly fix problems with the vesselâ€™s structure.

## Main components of the vehicle

ROV systems come in a variety of sizes and designs, but they often share **common features** made up of some or all of the elements outlined in the following sections.

### Hull design

Common hull design is open frame or close hull.

### Propulsion

There are three types of propulsion systems in ROV; Electrical, Hydaulic, and Ducted Jet.

#### a) Electrical

It uses electric motors to power propellers that provide thrust to move the ROV. The electrical power is typically supplied by a cable that is connected to a power source on the surface.

**Advantages**

- Ease of control
- High efficiency

#### b) Hydraulic

It uses a hydraulic system to power propellers that provide thrust to move the ROV. The hydraulic power is typically supplied by a pump that is located on the surface.

**Advantages**

- High power output
- Precise control
- High reliability

#### c) Ducted Jet

It uses water jets that are directed through ducts to provide thrust to move the ROV.

**Advantages**

- High manueverability
- Compact size
- Low noise level

### Navigation

### Data collection

ROV uses cameras, sonar, and other sensors to collect data.

### Data transmission

### Power management
