## History of AGV/AMR

### History of AGV:

- The first AGVs were introduced to industry in the 1950s, by Barrett Electronics of Northbrook, Illinois.

- Developed in mid-20th century for industrial manufacturing environments
- AGV is also called **laser guided vehicle (LGV)**
- First AGVs were automated carts that followed physical wire or magnetic tape on the floor
- Evolved to include more advanced navigation technologies, such as laser and vision-based guidance systems
- Used in a wide range of industries today, including automotive manufacturing, food and beverage production, and logistics

### History of AMR:

- First commercial models introduced in the 2000s
- Initially used in manufacturing and logistics, but now adopted in a range of other applications, such as healthcare, hospitality, and retail
- Advances in sensor technology and artificial intelligence have enabled AMRs to navigate complex and dynamic environments

The **first automotic lawnmower, Mowbot**, introduced in 1969.
